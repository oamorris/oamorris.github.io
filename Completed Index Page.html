	 <h1> Hi, Im Octavia Morris!</h1>
	 <ul>
	 Originally From Jersey "The Shore side of Things!" and became a lover for the South!
	</ul>
	<p>Since moving to North Carolina 15 years ago, I have come across some beautiful locations and I am excited to share them with you. These location are outisde of  the Raleigh area but so worth the drive.</p>
	<p>If I can, I love to travel home during the spring time where my family is able to get some exploring in without complaining about being super hot or freezing.</p>
	<p>So traveling the same road can get a little boring at times, but when your traveleing to a new adventure,where you about the create memeories, the excitment is beyond words. 
  <p>Since I love to travel and having a family of 7 can be a handful, but we make traveling fun, that we wished we had more days like that to enjoy.</p>
	<p>These places we come across are like hidden gems, they are barely advertised or a few people only know about it. So I'm here to "Spread The Love"!!!</p>

    <p>My Goal is to Impress you on &quot;Specific Locations&quot; so you can give a visit to be able to try something New!</p>
    <p>I would love to hear your stories, if you checked out the places listed so far? Dont be afraid to talk to me :)</p>

  <p>This was such a beautful Trip, we could go on and on about how much fun we had just and learning so much about the two beautiful horses we rode!</p>
  <p>We meaning  "My Fiance' and Myself" took this trip in mid-October 2022 and words couldnt describe the fun we had! This was more of a Romantic Date that I prayed didn't go wrong, since this was a surprise for him. We have never rode a horse before, better yet been so close to one and we decided to take them up a mountain! Yes! I agree, What were we thinking??</p>
	<div></div>
  <p>But it was unmarkly beautiful, the air was the  Freshest air to smell, felt so clean and it just took our breathes away.
	This trip can be taking year round, with children or without! there are private tours, beach tours if the mountains scare you. Its fun for any and everyone. If you feel you cant climb a horse, dont feel bad "We both needed help".
	  Also, a plus for us was that we actually felt like it was just us two riding horses, our tour guide Mike :) gave us the space we needed.
