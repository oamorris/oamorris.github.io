  <h1> Hi, Im Octavia Morris!</h1>
	 <ul>
	 Originally From Jersey "The Shore side of Things!" and became a lover for the South!
	</ul>
	<p>Since moving to North Carolina 15 years ago, I have come across some beautiful locations and I am excited to share them with you. These locations are outisde of  the Raleigh area but so worth the drive.</p>
	<p>If I can, I love to travel home during the spring time where my family is able to get some exploring in without complaining about being super hot or freezing.</p>
		
	<p>So traveling the same road can get a little boring at times, but when your traveleing to a new adventure,where you're about the create memeories, the excitment is beyond words. </p>
  <p>Since I love to travel and having a family of 7 can be a handful,  we make traveling fun, so fun, that we wished we had more days like that to enjoy.</p>
	<p>These places we come across are like hidden gems, they're barely advertised or a few people  know about it. So I'm here to "Spread The Love"!!!</p>

    <h3>
      <p> My Goal is to Impress you on &quot;Specific Locations&quot; that's barely talked about!!!</p></h3>
    <p>I plan to update my webpage every three months with a new 'WOW' locations including images, videos and guides on how to plan for these locations.</p></article>
<section class="section">	
  <p>At the bottom of the page I'm showing you an example of what kind of information you will be getting from me. It's no lie, I do have a huge family and because of that I find places where age can't be defined!!!</p>

  <p>This was such a beautful Trip, we could go on and on about how much fun we had just and learning so much about the two beautiful horses we rode!</p>
  <p>We meaning  "My Fiance' and Myself" took this trip in mid-October 2022 and words couldn't describe the fun we had! This was more of a Romantic Date that I prayed didn't go wrong, since this was a surprise for him. We have never rode a horse before, better yet been so close to one and we decided to take them up a mountain! Yes! I agree, What were we thinking??</p>
	<div></div>
  <p>But it was unmarkly beautiful, the air was the  Freshest air to smell, felt so clean and it just took our breathes away.
	This trip can be taking year round, with children or without! they offer private tours or beach tours ,if  riding up the mountains isn't your thang! It's fun for any and everyone. If you feel you can't climb a horse, dont feel bad "We both needed help".
	  Also, a plus for us was that we actually felt like it was just us two riding horses, our tour guide Mike :) gave us the space we needed.
